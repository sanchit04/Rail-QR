# INTRODUCTION

The project which is deployed by me truly supports Digital India movement and I am totally proud for the same. The idea to build RAIL-QR came to my mind when I was in my First Year standing in the long queue for just taking a concession certificate. That day I decided that Iâ€™ll surely try re-organizing this system. 

The concept, working and the yield of project is totally simple to understand with a complex back-end part. Basically, the system uses QR code to generate automated concession certificates which can be printed in couple of seconds thus cutting the slack of long queues.
